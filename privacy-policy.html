                        store Personal Information will not always involve a disclosure of Personal Information to
                        that overseas provider. However, by providing us with your Personal Information, you consent
                        to the storage of such information on overseas servers and acknowledge that APP 8.1 will not

                        recipient breaches the APPs, that entity will not be bound by, and you will not be able to
                        seek redress under, the Privacy Act.</p>
